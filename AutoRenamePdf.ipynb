Several authors have pointed \\nout that the combination of these two operations \\ndoes not simply add the individual complications \\nnumerically, but rather results in an exponential \\nincrease.5 Therefore, an abundance of articles \\nhave since been published portraying modifica-\\ntions of widely accepted techniques to produce ',\n",

In the year 2016, over \\n216,000 bariatric procedures were performed, and \\nthe numbers are expected to continue to rise.8–10 \\nAs massive weight loss patients become a grow-\\ning portion of the plastic surgery practice, special \\ncircumstances need to be considered in working \\nwith their specific tissue characteristics and their \\nperioperative care.

       " 'United States in 1992, plastic surgeons focused on \\nthe use of saline implants for breast augmentation \\nand reconstruction for 14 years. In 2006, the U.S. \\nFood and Drug Administration found no increased \\nrisk of rare adverse events and gave their stamp of \\napproval for use in plastic surgery. By 2010, half of \\nall breast implants used for augmentation or recon-\\nstruction in the United States were silicone devices.38 \\nAt that time, to help provide concise talking points \\nbetween doctors and cosmetic patients when dis-\\ncussing saline versus silicone implants, an article \\nwas published with a set of “salient points,” which \\nare listed in Table 2.39 Since that publication, addi-\\ntional research comparing the newer generation of \\nimplants (currently, we are on the fifth generation25) \\nand complication rates has been performed. Codner \\nand colleagues found that the most common overall \\ncomplication was capsular contracture with a rate of \\n8.2 percent at 6 years followed by rippling at 7.1 per-\\ncent.40 They found no significant difference when \\ncomparing rates of capsular contracture between \\nsaline and silicone implants over 6 years, and this \\nwas unaffected by pocket location. Rippling and \\nsize change were found to be the second and third \\nmost common complications in their study. Rip-\\npling was found more frequently when patients had \\nsaline implants placed in the subglandular position \\naccompanied by a low body mass index of less than \\n18.5 kg/m2.40 Considering revision surgery, Stevens \\net al. found that changing implant size was the most \\ncommon reason for reoperation when considering \\nimplant-related revisions after augmentation-masto-\\npexy.14 In their study, saline implants were used in \\n21 percent of the operations, and they concluded \\nthat 30 percent of all revision procedures were per-\\nformed on those implants.',\n",

BIA-ALCL was first \\ndiagnosed in 1994 and, by 2006, the number of \\npatients diagnosed was 11. Currently, the U.S. \\nFood and Drug Administration has reported 359 \\nadverse reports associated with BIA-ALCL, which \\nis an exponential increase, likely partially because \\nof increased levels of awareness and reporting, but \\nconcerning all the same. The current hypothesis \\nsuggests that chronic inflammation, which accom-\\npanies biofilms and bacterial burden, leads to \\nstimulation of T cells, which have been linked as a \\npotential inciting factor in BIA-ALCL.45 Textured \\nimplants result in an increased surface area com-\\npared with smooth implants and thus the possibil-\\nity of supporting a greater bacterial load. There \\nare some early indications that the more severe the \\ntexturing (nano versus micro versus macro), the \\nlarger the overall surface area, and thus the larger \\nthe possibility of supporting additional bacterial \\ncontamination.46 The incidence of the disease \\nhas been closely associated with these textured \\ndevices and their ability to support biofilm forma-\\ntion from such bacteria as Ralstonia species.45,47 ',\n",

If the surgeon finds that the nipple is \\nbelow the maximal projecting point on the breast, \\ntwo options are available to correct this: using a \\nshaped implant or performing a mastopexy. \\nShaped implants can offer a very slight degree \\nof nipple elevation because of the nature of the \\nupper pole slope and inferior pole projection.43,60 \\nThe degree of elevation is slight, usually less \\nthan 1 cm, but it can prevent an additional pro-\\ncedure (which carries the burden of additional \\nscarring) and still produce an aesthetically pleas-\\ning result. Others have found that after initial \\nimplant placement through a periareolar incision \\ninto the subpectoral pocket, the natural settling \\nof the implant, which occurs over the next 6 to 8 \\nmonths, will result in elevation of the nipple-are-\\nola complex to the desired location without the \\nneed for a mastopexy.61 They argue that by stag-\\ning the operation in this type of patient, one can \\npotentially avoid unnecessary scarring and trauma \\nto the breast.

Typical characteris-\\ntics of the breast in a massive weight loss patient \\ninclude loss of skin elasticity, grade 3 ptosis with \\nmedialization of the nipple-areola complex, a \\nlateral chest roll, asymmetry, and a loss of over-\\nall volume not confined to the upper pole.79–81 A \\nlarge component of breast surgery when work-\\ning with the massive weight loss patient is the \\napproach to parenchymal redistribution, various \\ndermal suspension techniques, and the princi-\\nple of autoaugmentation. Rubin et al. described \\ntheir technique of dermal suspension reshaping \\nwhere they used a Wise pattern and created and \\nsecured a central dermoglandular flap to the sec-\\nond rib periosteum, with the medial and lateral \\nflaps sutured around the central pedicle to pro-\\nduce an autoaugmented, rounded breast.79 They \\nfound seroma formation and wound healing to \\nbe the most frequent complications in their series \\nof breast patients. Coombs et al. presented one of \\nthe first series looking at augmentation-mastopexy \\nin massive weight loss patients using a single stage; \\na submuscular pocket; and either a periareolar, \\ninframammary, or transaxillary approach. In their \\nseries of 30 patients, they found that postoperative \\nptosis was present in 17 percent of their patients \\nat 3 months, and they had an overall implant mal-\\nposition rate of 62 percent. They postulate that \\nusing textured implants might help prevent these \\npotential complications in this subset of patients.80',\n",

Specifically, they \\nstate that lipoplasty-only breast reduction can \\nreduce breast size by up to two cup sizes, mini-\\nmize scars, and retain nipple sensation and the \\nability to breast feed.82 In a study of 475 lipo-\\nplasty-only breast reductions, Gray cites that, on \\naverage, 800 ml of volume is removed, which \\nresults in skin contraction, producing an aver-\\nage elevation of the nipple by 6 cm.82 Another \\nstudy went on to show the safety and reliability \\nof the liposuction-augmentation mammaplasty \\nby comparing it to mastopexy-augmentation \\nmammaplasty. The study examined 359 patients \\nand found that, by combining augmentation \\nthrough an inframammary fold incision and \\nliposuction focused on the lower pole of the \\nbreast (where the predominant concentration \\nof fat is located), they were able to achieve a 6 \\npercent change in the sternal notch–to-nipple \\ndistance.83 The revision rate was only 2.5 percent \\nin the liposuction group, and the mean opera-\\ntive time for bilateral procedures was 46 minutes \\ncompared with 90 minutes for standard aug-\\nmentation-mastopexy. Although liposuction is \\ncertainly not indicated in all cases, its role as an \\nadjunct in breast surgery is increasing and, given \\nits accessibility to the plastic surgeon, likely will \\ncontinue to grow.',\n",
